# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
The goal of this project is to create a simple and interactive dashboard to gain insights from previously reported data for decision making.

## Process
### (your step 1)
Review and familiarize with the data, data types, size, and features.

### (your step 2)
Select the best features that matters in decision making. In this dataset, it is the cost and number of reported engine strikes inflicted by birds, bats, mamals and others.

### (your step 3)
Create data visualizations that follows KISS (Keep It Simply Simple) and increase readability by highlighting the key numbers and using simple visualizations with less unnecessary visuals.

### (your step 4)
Create a dashboard that contains sections that houses different visualizations based on their category. In this case, based on cost, strikes, world map and heat map.

### (your step 6)
Integrate all data visualizations to make the dashboard interactive and to make each visuals act like its own filter.

### (your step 6)
Create another set of visualizations and dashboard to explain the key insights found from the dataset.



## Results

### Dataset: FAA Wildlife Strieks 2000-2015

### Data Visualizations
1. Simple Big Highlighted Numbers Cards
   - The cost and strikes have the biggest font and highlighted to draw the eye of the user to what matters the most.
3. Simple Number Cards
   - Give a simple breakdown of numbers in the least distractive manner using small and muted fonts and colour should the user decide to review the details.
5. Simple World Map with Simple Summary Card
   - To create a fun element where the user can select on which state to explore. The data card above the map is less distractive as much as possible but still provide the relevant data needed by the user.
7. Simple Time of day and Strikes Heatmap
   - Thea heatmap can be used by the user to select the year and time of the day as a reference to possible external datasets like the flight data during a specific time to avoid the flight tract which may have caused the most damaging flight.


## Challenges 
Tableau seems too restrictive in letting a user define where to place a visual card on the dashboard, unlike PowerBI.

## Future Goals
-Acquire flight record to see which flight path may have caused the most costly or with most incidents of engine strikes.
